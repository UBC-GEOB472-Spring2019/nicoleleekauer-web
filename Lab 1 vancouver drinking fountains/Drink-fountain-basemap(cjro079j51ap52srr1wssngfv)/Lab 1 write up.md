# Reflective Analysis
This map is designed for urban dwellers that bike and walk around the City of Vancouver. As a city that is becoming increasingly walkable and transit-friendly, we need to ensure there is high accessibility to a basic need such as safe drinking water. Particularly with summer just around the corner, Vancouver often experience droughts due to water deficit. This map will help urban dwellers to plan their routes around the city, particularly for those who bike and need to refill. 
For the base layers, I chose to display the background with two different colors using the zoom range function. When it is zoomed out, it will gradually change from a beige color to light blue color. Since this is a map indicating water source, I want the overall color scheme to be cohesive. At approximately 10.20 zoom level, the dark blue color of the ocean, the light blue color of the background, and the cyan color of the water fountain symbols are displayed cohesively. Therefore, the audience can be immediately informed that the map is indicative of water sources around Vancouver. As you zoom in, the water fountain symbols are contrasted with a light beige color. This is the base background color for many navigation apps such as Maps on iPhones and Google Maps. This should increase a sense of familiarity, which makes the map more user-friendly. 
I chose a light green for the landuse layer, which were polygons of community parks, schools, and community centers. As I’ve mentioned, this map is intended for the use of urban dwellers. From Patrick Condon’s Seven Rules of Sustainable Cities, he highlighted the importance of connecting green spaces with water bodies. While schools and community spaces are often displayed as yellow, I wanted the map to encourage urban dwellers to explore small parks and community spaces that they would otherwise miss when roaming around the city. Moreover, I used dark green for national parks to inform users that those areas have higher density of vegetation. As for the choice in labelling, I chose a light orange color for local eateries. This will only be displayed as the map is zoomed in, approximately at 14.10 level. I made this choice to inform users not only of accessibility to safe drinking water, but also nearby restaurants for when they are hungry from walking around. 
I’ve constructed this map based on my learning from Andy Skinner’s article Introducing a Human Geography Basemap. From this reflective analysis, I’ve discussed the four components of base, subject, detail and labels he described. I believe my map can be improved if more properties are added to each drinking fountain. For instance, I would like a real life image to appear next to the drink fountain when I hover the cursor on it. This can be helpful for users to know what to look out for when they are passing the drink fountain.

# Critique session
I received help from Professor Luke Bergmann and Jamie Li. Professor Luke Bergmann directed me to insightful resources and guided through the workflow. We conversed mainly through Canvas. Jamie helped me understand the differences between different datasets and data format (Geojson, json, csv…). She was new to the world of interactive mapping, but was able to apply her knowledge from computer science to help me learn. She introduced me to basic editing platforms such as Atom, which I intend to use more often in the future.
